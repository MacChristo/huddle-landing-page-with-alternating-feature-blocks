## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

My next focus is JS.

### Useful resources

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) - Font Awesome is really helpful when you want to get nice icons for your projects. It also gives you the opportunity to edit the icon styles(e.g icon color, size, hover states etc) without the need for JS or JQuery.
